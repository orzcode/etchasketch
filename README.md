toggle and clear buttons - try using 'while' or loops instead of 'foreach'

make mouseover event include click/drag



Extra Credit
Instead of just changing the color of a square from black to white (for example), have each pass through with the mouse change it to a completely random RGB value. Then try having each pass just add another 10% of black to it so that only after 10 passes is the square completely black.
