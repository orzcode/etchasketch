**Etch-a-Sketch project**

This was a Javascript project for an Etch-a-Sketch which involved a lot of DOM manipulation and interaction between JS and CSS styles. Due to the number of buttons, and my desire to retain active button states (and the outlines showing this) between grid resizes, numerous functions were used and re-worked over the course of the project, including most recently a 'button manager' function to handle this more cleanly.

Responsivity was not a goal for this project as the nature of such an etchasketch is that it's difficult to use on mobile, i.e. with thumbs. A mouse is required for best results. However, minor responsivity was implemented anyway for resizing to a different layout (column vs original row) for smaller screens. This may be polished as a stretch target.

In addition to the standard paintbrush, comedy options were included which were originally going to be simple rainbow colors, however I decided to spice this up with some background images and then went a mile further with the psychokek option - and as I was using this image decided to dedicate the project to El Risitas (the guy in the image) as he recently passed away. RIP.

This was a very educative project that required a surprising amount of research and investigation to various JS methods and how they work.


Possible future button additions:
Instead of just changing the color of a square from black to white (for example), have each pass through with the mouse change it to a completely random RGB value. Then having each pass just add another 10% of black to it so that only after 10 passes is the square completely black.
